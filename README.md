# js-dom-quotes
## Set up

1. Clone this repo and `cd js-dom-quotes`
- Open the index page in your browser: `chrome index.html`
- Open Chrome's developer tools: <kbd>command + option + j</kbd>
- Select and inspect the "elements" from top ribbon

## Exercise


This is an exercise in finding elements on the page (in the DOM).

Your task is to write javascript, in the '/js/vanilla-solution.js' file to retrieve the objects which represent these elements.

Start with these:

1. Select the `<body>`
- Select the `<header>`
- Select all of the elements with class "quote"
- Select all of the subject elements
- Select the navigation links
- Select all the quotes in the "life" section.
- Using **relative** selection, select the `<p>` element containing the second Mark Twain quote
- Do the same using a query selector
- Select the 'Quotes About Motivation' heading
- The first section has a class 'subject', preserve it, and add a class 'simplicity' as well.


### Bonus

- Create an element with the text of your favorite quote.
- Add the element that you created in the previous step to the layout by appending it to a corresponding subject section.
- Add the author's last name, as a class name, to one of the quotes.
